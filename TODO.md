#To do
- The application has a button to access the user's timeline but at the moment the timeline is only printed to stdout when this button is pressed. Need to modify the GUI so that it has a spot for the timeline to be displayed
- Need to write a method in the TwitterManager class that can access the user's @ replies (COMPLETE)
- Need to think about how we are going to display @ replies in the GUI and build this functionality into the TwitterView class
- Need to write a method in the TwitterManager class that can access the user's DMs (COMPLETE)
- Need to think about how we are going to display the user's DMs - maybe it is not a good idea for this to be displayed in the GUI unless the user clicks to a different screen. Not sure. Open to ideas. 
- Might be a good idea to add functionality that allows the user to  search tweets or search hash tags. Some ways off though I think.
