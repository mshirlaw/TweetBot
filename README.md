#TweetBot
A simple twitter client using the twitter4j API. 

#About
The twitter4j API is available at twitter4j.org. This repository includes the complete eclipse project as well as the required .jar libraries.

#Important
Before you are able to use this client you must create an app at dev.twitter.com and copy your CONSUMER_KEY and CONSUMER_SECRET into the TwitterManager.java class. You will then need to authorise the application to post on your behalf. 

#Future updates
This is a work in progress and will be updated with new features shortly.
