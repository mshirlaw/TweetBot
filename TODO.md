#To do
- The application has a button to access the user's timeline but at the moment the timeline is only printed to stdout when this button is pressed. Need to modify the GUI so that it has a spot for the timeline to be displayed (GUI changed to avoid this)
- Need to write a method in the TwitterManager class that can access the user's @ replies (COMPLETE)
- Need to think about how we are going to display @ replies in the GUI and build this functionality into the TwitterView class (COMPLETE)
- Need to write a method in the TwitterManager class that can access the user's DMs (COMPLETE)
- Write a method to send a direct message to a given user
- Need to write a class for sending tweets - I expect that the user will press the tweet button and a new window will pop up which allows the user to type/send their tweet
- Might be a good idea to add functionality that allows the user to  search tweets or search hash tags. Some ways off though I think.
